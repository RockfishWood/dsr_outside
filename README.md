## Commercial Fishery Development and History
The DSR fishery has been active since the late 1979 and catch data prior to 1992 is problematic due to changes in the DSR species assemblage as well as the lack of a directed fishery harvest card prior to 1990 for CSEO, SSEO, and NSEO, and in 1992 for EYKT. The directed DSR catch in SEO was above 350 t in the mid-1990s. Since 1998, landings have been below 250 t, and since 2005, directed landings have typically been less than 100 t. During the reported years total harvest peaked at 604 t in 1994, and directed harvest peaked at 381 t in 1994. Although directed landings were higher in the 1990s, since 2000, 58.7% of the DSR total reported catch is from incidental catch of DSR in the halibut fishery. It should be emphasized, however, that prior to 2005, unreported mortality from incidental catch of DSR associated with the halibut and other non-directed fisheries is unknown and may have been as great as a few hundred tons annually. This is due to full retention requirements that were passed by the NPFMC in 1998 did not go into effect until 2005 where fishermen are required to retain and report all DSR caught.  Directed commercial fishery landings have often been constrained by other fishery management actions. In 1992, the directed DSR fishery was allotted a separate halibut prohibited species cap (PSC) and is therefore no longer affected when the PSC is met for other longline fisheries in the GOA. In 1993, the directed fishery was closed early due to an unanticipated increase in DSR incidental catch during the halibut fishery. However, now the incidental catch must be projected because the directed fishery occurs before the Pacific halibut fishery, which starts in mid-March. 

Directed commercial fisheries are held in the four management areas (EYKT, NSEO, SSEO, and CSEO) if there is sufficient quota available after the DSR mortality in other commercial fisheries (primarily the IFQ halibut fishery) is estimated. The directed fishery in NSEO has been closed since 1995; the total allocation for this management area has not been sufficient to prosecute an orderly fishery. The directed commercial DSR fisheries in the CSEO and SSEO management areas were not opened in 2005 because it was estimated that total mortality in the sport fishery was significant and combined with the directed commercial fishery would likely result in exceeding the TAC. No directed fisheries occurred in 2006 or 2007 in the SEO district as ADFG took action in two areas; one was to enact management measures to keep the catch of DSR in the sport fishery to the levels mandated by the Board of Fisheries (BOF), and the other was to further compare the estimations of incidental catch in the halibut fishery to the actual landings from full retention regulations in the commercial fishery in those years to see how closely our predicted incidental catch matched commercial landings. From 2008–2014, there was sufficient quota to hold directed commercial fisheries in at least two of the four SEO management areas. From 2015–2017, only EYKT, and in 2018 only CSEO were open to directed fishing.
